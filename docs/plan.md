## 2. Core Framework Integration Standards

Every model implementation must strictly adhere to the following shared framework patterns:

1. **Scale Quantization ([js/scale.js](file:///c:/Users/kj6fi/Dropbox/git/fm1-pulses/js/scale.js))**:
   - Always resolve pitch using `getRootMidi()`, `getActiveScaleIntervals()`, and `quantize(rawMidi, intervals, root)`.
2. **Audio & MIDI Engine ([js/player.js](file:///c:/Users/kj6fi/Dropbox/git/fm1-pulses/js/player.js))**:
   - Live note triggers dispatch via `liveNoteOn(note, vel, durMs)` and `liveNoteOff(note)`.
   - Continuous timbre modulation dispatches via `midi.sendControlChange(ccDest, ccVal)` (typically CC #74 Brightness / Cutoff via `dispatchTimbreCc`).
3. **Polyphony Ceiling & Voice Allocation Manager ([js/poly.js](file:///c:/Users/kj6fi/Dropbox/git/fm1-pulses/js/poly.js))**:
   - Every polyphonic model reuses `selectPolyVoices(candidates, maxVoices, strategy)` and `playVoice()`, respecting global `state.polyphony` (1–8) and `state.polyStrategy` (Extrema, Lowest, Highest, Spread, Cluster, Cycle, Random).
   - Guarantees strict $\le 8$ voices FIFO stealing for M-VAVE FM-1 hardware buffer safety and dual MIDI / browser synth dispatch.
   - Polyphony controls are housed in the Notes div and automatically hidden on monophonic models.
4. **Session Snapshot Serialization ([js/snapshot.js](file:///c:/Users/kj6fi/Dropbox/git/fm1-pulses/js/snapshot.js))**:
   - Register under `registerModel({ id, version: 1, migrations: {}, capture(), restore(h) })`.
   - Register ownership prefix in `PREFIX` within `js/snapshot.js`.
5. **State & Lifecycle ([js/state.js](file:///c:/Users/kj6fi/Dropbox/git/fm1-pulses/js/state.js), [js/modes.js](file:///c:/Users/kj6fi/Dropbox/git/fm1-pulses/js/modes.js), [js/rack.js](file:///c:/Users/kj6fi/Dropbox/git/fm1-pulses/js/rack.js))**:
   - Mirror pitch parameters (`scale`, `root`, `pitchSpan`).
   - Wire `init<Model>()`, `activate<Model>Model()`, and `deactivate<Model>Model()`.
   - Supply `generate<Model>Bank()` returning a valid bank structure (`[{ length: seqLen, steps, rate }]`) so step-based UI components never throw undefined errors.
6. **Workbench Aesthetics ([.agents/rules/style.md](file:///c:/Users/kj6fi/Dropbox/git/fm1-pulses/.agents/rules/style.md))**:
   - Zero CSS or canvas gradients (`linear-gradient`, `createLinearGradient`).
   - Dynamic token resolution via `getComputedStyle(document.documentElement)` (`--panel`, `--panel2`, `--line`, `--accent`, `--ok`, `--err`).

## 3. Active Specification: Brownian Thermal Ratchet / Feynman Thermal Diode

- **Model ID**: `brownian_ratchet`
- **Category**: Statistical Mechanics / Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics / Thermal Langevin Fluctuations.
- **Architectural Scope**: Simulates Richard Feynman’s microscopic thermal ratchet: a paddle wheel immersed in a fluctuating thermal bath $(T_1)$ drives a toothed cogwheel restricted to unidirectional forward rotation by an asymmetric pawl and spring immersed in a separate heat bath $(T_2)$.
- **Mathematical Formulation**:
  - Overdamped Langevin equation of motion:
    $$\gamma \frac{d\theta}{dt} = -\frac{dV(\theta)}{d\theta} - \tau_{\text{load}} + \sqrt{2 \gamma k_B T_1} \xi(t)$$
  - Asymmetric sawtooth potential energy barrier $V(\theta)$ with spatial asymmetry ratio $L_1 / L_2 \neq 1$.
  - Thermal rectifier work output: Forward stochastic ratcheting occurs whenever $T_1 > T_2$, while reverse slippage occurs under high counter-torque load.
- **Musical Mapping**:
  - Each ratchet forward tooth click triggers quantized rhythmic step advances across up to 8 polyphonic pawl chimes.
  - Thermal temperature differential $\Delta T = T_1 - T_2$ and mechanical counter-torque modulate stepping probability and burst cadence.
  - Instantaneous thermal velocity variance modulates continuous CC #74 Brightness.

## 4. Backlog Models Catalogue (Two-Sentence References)

For future reference and extension, these additional models are documented with concise descriptions:

1. **Electroplankton "Tracy" Ribbon Path Trajectory**: Inspired by Toshio Iwai’s Tracy plankton species, the user draws continuous organic vector gestures across an aquatic canvas, spawning a creature that perpetually navigates the closed contour. As the creature traverses segments of the ribbon, local curvature, speed, and heading direction are continuously translated into quantized pitch shifts, gate lengths, and expressive FM modulation envelopes.
2. **Self-Avoiding Random Walk (Polymer Chain Folding)**: A growing molecular polymer chain steps randomly onto neighboring unoccupied lattice nodes while strictly forbidding self-intersection. When the chain approaches conformational jamming (steric hindrance traps), the chain collapses and folds with an explosive, harmonically resolved chord cascade before initiating a new structural domain.
