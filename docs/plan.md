## 2. Core Framework Integration Standards

Every model implementation must strictly adhere to the following shared framework patterns:

1. **Scale Quantization ([js/scale.js](file:///c:/Users/kj6fi/Dropbox/git/fm1-pulses/js/scale.js))**:
   - Always resolve pitch using `getRootMidi()`, `getActiveScaleIntervals()`, and `quantize(rawMidi, intervals, root)`.
2. **Audio & MIDI Engine ([js/player.js](file:///c:/Users/kj6fi/Dropbox/git/fm1-pulses/js/player.js))**:
   - Live note triggers dispatch via `liveNoteOn(note, vel, durMs)` and `liveNoteOff(note)`.
   - Continuous timbre modulation dispatches via `midi.sendControlChange(ccDest, ccVal)` (typically CC #74 Brightness / Cutoff via `dispatchTimbreCc`).
3. **Polyphony Ceiling & Voice Allocation Manager ([js/poly.js](file:///c:/Users/kj6fi/Dropbox/git/fm1-pulses/js/poly.js))**:
   - Every polyphonic model reuses `selectPolyVoices(candidates, maxVoices, strategy)` and `playVoice()`, respecting global `state.polyphony` (1–8) and `state.polyStrategy` (Extrema, Lowest, Highest, Spread, Cluster, Cycle, Random).
   - Guarantees strict $\le 8$ voices FIFO stealing for M-VAVE FM-1 hardware buffer safety and dual MIDI / browser synth dispatch.
   - Polyphony controls are housed in the Notes div and automatically hidden on monophonic models.
4. **Session Snapshot Serialization ([js/snapshot.js](file:///c:/Users/kj6fi/Dropbox/git/fm1-pulses/js/snapshot.js))**:
   - Register under `registerModel({ id, version: 1, migrations: {}, capture(), restore(h) })`.
   - Register ownership prefix in `PREFIX` within `js/snapshot.js`.
5. **State & Lifecycle ([js/state.js](file:///c:/Users/kj6fi/Dropbox/git/fm1-pulses/js/state.js), [js/modes.js](file:///c:/Users/kj6fi/Dropbox/git/fm1-pulses/js/modes.js), [js/rack.js](file:///c:/Users/kj6fi/Dropbox/git/fm1-pulses/js/rack.js))**:
   - Mirror pitch parameters (`scale`, `root`, `pitchSpan`).
   - Wire `init<Model>()`, `activate<Model>Model()`, and `deactivate<Model>Model()`.
   - Supply `generate<Model>Bank()` returning a valid bank structure (`[{ length: seqLen, steps, rate }]`) so step-based UI components never throw undefined errors.
6. **Workbench Aesthetics ([.agents/rules/style.md](file:///c:/Users/kj6fi/Dropbox/git/fm1-pulses/.agents/rules/style.md))**:
   - Zero CSS or canvas gradients (`linear-gradient`, `createLinearGradient`).
   - Dynamic token resolution via `getComputedStyle(document.documentElement)` (`--panel`, `--panel2`, `--line`, `--accent`, `--ok`, `--err`).

## 3. Active Specification: High-Order Markov Transition Matrix Melodic Memory

- **Model ID**: `markov_matrix`
- **Category**: Stochastic Melodic Memory / Discrete State Probability / Aleatoric Transitions.
- **Architectural Scope**: A dynamic Markov transition network modeling musical memory. Given the previous $k$ notes/intervals ($k \in \{1, 2, 3\}$), the next pitch and rhythmic duration are selected via conditional transition probability vectors $P(S_{t} \mid S_{t-1}, \dots, S_{t-k})$ shaped by a temperature/entropy parameter.

### Mathematical Formulation
Conditional transition distribution with Boltzmann temperature scaling:
$$P(s_j \mid \text{history}) = \frac{\exp(M(\text{history}, s_j) / \tau)}{\sum_k \exp(M(\text{history}, s_k) / \tau)}$$

Where:
- $M(\text{history}, s_j)$ is the log-frequency / transition weight matrix between scale degrees or interval classes.
- $\tau$ is the stochastic temperature parameter ($\tau \to 0$ locks rigidly into deterministic cyclic motifs; $\tau \to \infty$ produces uniform aleatoric exploration).
- Multiple voice channels (up to 8 voices) operate in parallel Markov walkers or voice-leading strands respecting the FM-1 hardware voice limit.

### Musical Mapping
- **Scale Degrees & Voice Strands**: Polyphonic Markov walkers (up to 8 voices) generate polyphonic counterpoint.
- **Direct Manipulation**: Interactive transition probability heatmap / network transition graph where clicking nodes or cells alters transition probabilities in real time.
- **Continuous CC #74 Modulation**: Information entropy $H = -\sum P \log P$ of the instantaneous transition matrix modulates CC #74 Brightness.

## 4. Backlog Models Catalogue (Two-Sentence References)

For future reference and extension, these additional models are documented with concise descriptions:

1. **Interactive Genetic Algorithm Melodic Genome Breeder**: Maintains a breeding population of musical chromosome vectors encoding rhythm, scale degree intervals, and gate envelopes, subjected to mutation and crossover operations. The user tags sounding motifs with positive or negative interactive fitness scores, steering the evolutionary survival and emergence of complex, personalized musical themes over successive generations.
2. **Chladni Acoustic Resonant Plate & Nodal Sand Patterns**: Simulates Ernst Chladni’s vibrating square acoustic plates where virtual sand grains are propelled off anti-nodal zones and settle onto geometric nodal lines defined by 2D standing wave eigenfunctions $\cos(n \pi x / L)\cos(m \pi y / L) - \cos(m \pi x / L)\cos(n \pi y / L) = 0$. Grains settling into equilibrium nodal pockets trigger micro-tonal chime harmonics that shift dramatically as modal vibrational frequencies $m$ and $n$ are swept.
3. **Brownian Ratchet / Feynman Thermal Diode**: A microscopic mechanical paddle immersed in a fluctuating thermal bath attempts to drive a cogwheel restricted to unidirectional rotation by an asymmetric spring-loaded pawl. Stochastic thermal collisions occasionally overcome the pawl barrier, generating aperiodic rhythmic step advances whose statistical burst frequencies are governed by temperature and mechanical load.
4. **Electroplankton "Tracy" Ribbon Path Trajectory**: Inspired by Toshio Iwai’s Tracy plankton species, the user draws continuous organic vector gestures across an aquatic canvas, spawning a creature that perpetually navigates the closed contour. As the creature traverses segments of the ribbon, local curvature, speed, and heading direction are continuously translated into quantized pitch shifts, gate lengths, and expressive FM modulation envelopes.
5. **Self-Avoiding Random Walk (Polymer Chain Folding)**: A growing molecular polymer chain steps randomly onto neighboring unoccupied lattice nodes while strictly forbidding self-intersection. When the chain approaches conformational jamming (steric hindrance traps), the chain collapses and folds with an explosive, harmonically resolved chord cascade before initiating a new structural domain.
