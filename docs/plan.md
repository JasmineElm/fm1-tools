## 2. Core Framework Integration Standards

Every model implementation must strictly adhere to the following shared framework patterns:

1. **Scale Quantization ([js/scale.js](file:///c:/Users/kj6fi/Dropbox/git/fm1-pulses/js/scale.js))**:
   - Always resolve pitch using `getRootMidi()`, `getActiveScaleIntervals()`, and `quantize(rawMidi, intervals, root)`.
2. **Audio & MIDI Engine ([js/player.js](file:///c:/Users/kj6fi/Dropbox/git/fm1-pulses/js/player.js))**:
   - Live note triggers dispatch via `liveNoteOn(note, vel, durMs)` and `liveNoteOff(note)`.
   - Continuous timbre modulation dispatches via `midi.sendControlChange(ccDest, ccVal)` (typically CC #74 Brightness / Cutoff via `dispatchTimbreCc`).
3. **Polyphony Ceiling & Voice Allocation Manager ([js/poly.js](file:///c:/Users/kj6fi/Dropbox/git/fm1-pulses/js/poly.js))**:
   - Every polyphonic model reuses `selectPolyVoices(candidates, maxVoices, strategy)` and `playVoice()`, respecting global `state.polyphony` (1–8) and `state.polyStrategy` (Extrema, Lowest, Highest, Spread, Cluster, Cycle, Random).
   - Guarantees strict $\le 8$ voices FIFO stealing for M-VAVE FM-1 hardware buffer safety and dual MIDI / browser synth dispatch.
   - Polyphony controls are housed in the Notes div and automatically hidden on monophonic models.
4. **Session Snapshot Serialization ([js/snapshot.js](file:///c:/Users/kj6fi/Dropbox/git/fm1-pulses/js/snapshot.js))**:
   - Register under `registerModel({ id, version: 1, migrations: {}, capture(), restore(h) })`.
   - Register ownership prefix in `PREFIX` within `js/snapshot.js`.
5. **State & Lifecycle ([js/state.js](file:///c:/Users/kj6fi/Dropbox/git/fm1-pulses/js/state.js), [js/modes.js](file:///c:/Users/kj6fi/Dropbox/git/fm1-pulses/js/modes.js), [js/rack.js](file:///c:/Users/kj6fi/Dropbox/git/fm1-pulses/js/rack.js))**:
   - Mirror pitch parameters (`scale`, `root`, `pitchSpan`).
   - Wire `init<Model>()`, `activate<Model>Model()`, and `deactivate<Model>Model()`.
   - Supply `generate<Model>Bank()` returning a valid bank structure (`[{ length: seqLen, steps, rate }]`) so step-based UI components never throw undefined errors.
6. **Workbench Aesthetics ([.agents/rules/style.md](file:///c:/Users/kj6fi/Dropbox/git/fm1-pulses/.agents/rules/style.md))**:
   - Zero CSS or canvas gradients (`linear-gradient`, `createLinearGradient`).
   - Dynamic token resolution via `getComputedStyle(document.documentElement)` (`--panel`, `--panel2`, `--line`, `--accent`, `--ok`, `--err`).

## 3. Active Specification: Interactive Genetic Algorithm Melodic Genome Breeder

- **Model ID**: `genetic_breeder`
- **Category**: Evolutionary Biology / Genetic Algorithms / Interactive Fitness Breeding.
- **Architectural Scope**: Maintains a population of musical genome chromosomes (encoding 16-step pitch intervals, gate triggers, velocities, and rhythm accents). Features one-point or uniform genetic crossover, mutation perturbations, and direct interactive user fitness evaluation (upvote/downvote buttons or dragging genomes in a 2D fitness arena).
- **Mathematical Formulation**:
  - Chromosome representation: Array of genes $g_i = (\Delta\text{pitch}, \text{gate}, \text{velocity}, \text{accent})$.
  - Crossover: $C_1, C_2 = \text{Crossover}(P_1, P_2)$ with user-defined crossover probability $p_c \in [0.5, 0.95]$.
  - Mutation: Random allele perturbation with probability $p_m \in [0.01, 0.25]$.
  - Fitness proportional selection / tournament selection to produce the next generation.
- **Musical Mapping**:
  - Up to 8 concurrent active genomes auditioning in polyphonic counterpoint.
  - Interactive workbench UI showing generational lineage, fitness landscape, and chromosome mutation controls.
  - Mean genetic variance across the population modulates continuous CC #74 Brightness.

## 4. Backlog Models Catalogue (Two-Sentence References)

For future reference and extension, these additional models are documented with concise descriptions:

1. **Chladni Acoustic Resonant Plate & Nodal Sand Patterns**: Simulates Ernst Chladni’s vibrating square acoustic plates where virtual sand grains are propelled off anti-nodal zones and settle onto geometric nodal lines defined by 2D standing wave eigenfunctions $\cos(n \pi x / L)\cos(m \pi y / L) - \cos(m \pi x / L)\cos(n \pi y / L) = 0$. Grains settling into equilibrium nodal pockets trigger micro-tonal chime harmonics that shift dramatically as modal vibrational frequencies $m$ and $n$ are swept.
2. **Brownian Ratchet / Feynman Thermal Diode**: A microscopic mechanical paddle immersed in a fluctuating thermal bath attempts to drive a cogwheel restricted to unidirectional rotation by an asymmetric spring-loaded pawl. Stochastic thermal collisions occasionally overcome the pawl barrier, generating aperiodic rhythmic step advances whose statistical burst frequencies are governed by temperature and mechanical load.
3. **Electroplankton "Tracy" Ribbon Path Trajectory**: Inspired by Toshio Iwai’s Tracy plankton species, the user draws continuous organic vector gestures across an aquatic canvas, spawning a creature that perpetually navigates the closed contour. As the creature traverses segments of the ribbon, local curvature, speed, and heading direction are continuously translated into quantized pitch shifts, gate lengths, and expressive FM modulation envelopes.
4. **Self-Avoiding Random Walk (Polymer Chain Folding)**: A growing molecular polymer chain steps randomly onto neighboring unoccupied lattice nodes while strictly forbidding self-intersection. When the chain approaches conformational jamming (steric hindrance traps), the chain collapses and folds with an explosive, harmonically resolved chord cascade before initiating a new structural domain.
